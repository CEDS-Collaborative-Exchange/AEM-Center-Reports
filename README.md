# National Center on Accessible Digital Educational Materials Reports
The Accessible Educational Materials (AEM) Report within the CEDS Collaborative Exchange repository is designed to support the analysis of policy questions related to the accessibility of educational materials and technologies, as well as to identify and address disparities and barriers in access to these resources. The resulting Power BI report leverages developed CEDS connections, which aim to standardize data collection in areas where SEAs (State Education Agencies), LEAs (Local Education Agencies), and schools are not currently required to collect data. Despite the absence of this data, the creation of this CEDS repository, the Power BI report and its underlying CEDS connections seeks to encourage the gathering of information.
